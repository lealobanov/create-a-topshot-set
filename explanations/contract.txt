The Set and SetData structures in the Recipe contract are designed to organize and manage collectibles efficiently. SetData is a lightweight struct that holds basic metadata for each Set, such as its unique ID, name, and series. This information is stored in a contract-wide dictionary (setDatas) to make it easily accessible for reading. On the other hand, the Set resource represents an actual group of plays (collectibles) and contains more detailed functionality. It manages a list of plays, tracks whether plays are retired, keeps a count of moments minted for each play, and ensures no further changes are made once the Set is locked.

When creating a Set, the admin uses the createSet function to initialize a Set resource and its associated SetData. The Set resource also provides functions to add plays, retire them, lock the Set, and mint moments. Each function is carefully controlled with checks to ensure valid operations. For example, you can only add a play if it exists and the Set is unlocked. Similarly, minting a moment requires the play to be active and not retired. The lock function prevents any further modifications, ensuring the integrity of the Set.

Overall, this structure separates metadata from operational data, making the contract easier to maintain and scale. It ensures only authorized actions can occur, while keeping data accessible and operations straightforward for both developers and users.
