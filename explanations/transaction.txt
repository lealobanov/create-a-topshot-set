To create a Set in the TopShot contract, the transaction first retrieves a reference to the Admin resource. This is done by borrowing the Admin resource from the signer's account storage using the specified storage path (/storage/TopShotAdmin). If the resource is not found, the transaction will terminate with an error.

Once the reference to the Admin resource is obtained, the transaction calls the createSet function, providing the name for the new Set (in this case, "Rookies"). This function creates a new Set resource and automatically adds it to the sets dictionary for management, while also updating the corresponding SetData entry for metadata. After successfully creating the Set, the transaction logs a confirmation message.

This flow ensures that only authorized accounts with access to the Admin resource can create new Sets.
